<h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>Introduction</b></h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">Hello,
    My name is Angelo Goduto and I am from South Elgin, IL. South Elgin
    is about one hour North of Lewis University. In South Elgin, I have my
    Father, Bob, my Mother, Melanie, my sister, Natalie, and my newest 
    member of the family, Bentley, my Golden Retriever. We recently lost
    our Golden of 13 years Tazer and I will personally say, he was the best
    dog ever. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">While at Lewis University, I am currently 
    studying Aviation Administration with a minor in Business Administration.
    When I first came to Lewis, I was studying Aviation Flight Management.
    I earned my Private Pilot's license while at Lewis, but COVID-19 took a
    major strike on my degree and I found it healthier for me to move on from
    flying until after I graduated. While taking this course, I hope to learn
    the basics of accounting and then move past the basics. Coding is 
    a money maker in any business and I believe having any type of 
    background would be useful in the future. I'm intrigued to learn about
    the security part in later chapters, but for know, I do believe I have
    already learned a lot from this class.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>If I had to put the topics I am excited for
    in a list, I would say:</b></h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square; text-align:center; list-style-position:inside;">
    <li >Security</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Networks</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>My Favorite Hobby</b></h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">I would say my favorite hobbies would include
    hanging with friends, watching sports, and flying. I currently live with
    4 other roomates and yes, living in a house with this many boys can be hard,
    but we're pretty good at pushing past the negatives and looking towards the 
    positives. When I was younger, I played baseball, hockey, and golf. While playing
    hockey I earned the Assistant Captain postion my sophomore year and the Captain
    postion my Junior and Senior year. During that time, I made several friends. Hockey
    creates bonds forever. Two of my current roommates are from when I played hockey in
    Middle School. We still have the same bond that we did when we were younger.  </p>
